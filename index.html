    <h1>My Bio</h1>
      <p>I'm Chang,Tzu-Hsien. A sophomore student studying on computer science
        in National Taipei University of Education.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>My studying process</li>
        <p> Since I was in junior high school, I have been totally fascinated by
          the world created by codes and numbers. I usually spend my spare time
          watching Scientific American magazine, business weekly, and subscribe
          MIT Technology Review. When I was in the summer vacation in grade 11,
          I started to learn Python Programming by myself, which change my
          impression on coding. After two years of practicing, now I have
          clearer computational thinking concept, ability to analyze problems
          and using data structure and algorithm ways to find the best solution
          to the problem. In the future, I wish I can use my programming
          background combined with economics and finance ability, analyzing
          different kinds of business models and the force behind them. </p>
        <li>Extracurricular activities</li>
        <p> Due to my strong curiosity, I participated in school information
          research club and become the lead when I'm in sophomore. At this
          period of time, by teaching member how to scraping web data, data
          manipulation, data visulation using python, it makes me to digest what
          I have learned and how to use my words to teach others. Besides, our
          clubs also hold some lecture, cooprate other school's programming
          club, which enhance my communication skills and organize ability.</p>
        <li>Motivation</li>
        <p> The motivation I select Google Summer Intern as my priority target
          is that I have learned that Google has been famous for its abundant
          technology product covering from Google Home(NLP product) to
          Tensorflow(AI training tool), working with awesome colleague, and the
          most important is having a innovative and flexible company culture,
          employees are encouraged to work when they like. Besides, I have known
          Google is famous for its globalized working circumstances, using
          English to communicate with each others. By this chance, I can also
          practicing my English speech more fluently.</p>
        <li>Future goal</li>
        <p> With the technology advanced, chatbot has penetrated to every aspect
          in people’s life. Unfortunately, chatbot still only exists in
          electronic devices, they didn’t have their own appearance, nowadays.
          So I came up with an idea, tried to use face recognition database
          combined with voice recognition database, creating a “real-life”
          chatbot, which make users can interact with them through VR
          head-mounted display. In addition to these basic functions, first, I
          want to make system to change the chatbot’s appearance through user’s
          description. Second, the chatbot is not just can answer users some
          questions that can be solved by searching engine, it can also play
          cards with users, take pictures with users etc., some leisure
          activities. Third, in order to make users have the best experience, it
          enables users to select background when interacting with the chatbot.
          I want to create a “virtual friend” to those who has obstacle to
          interacting with real people in daily life, enable them back to
          society again. This is one of my start up ideas, although these ideas
          was in opinion stage, I hope that I can make them come true through
          working in Google, helps me cultivate designing a product ability, and
          broaden my horizons.</p>
